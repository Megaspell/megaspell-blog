As promised, first public demo is here.

You can:
- Try out gameplay, including combat system.
- Check character controls.
- See new, exclusive and shiny PipBuck 2100 by @DeadAir

**What you WON'T see**: more than 1 map and more than 1 game mode. This demo was prepared in a short time to be able to get player feedback in realtime. Unfortunately many people have unrealistic expectations and that's sad.

**Please, report bugs in our Discord in #game-en channel, and don't forget to ping @Shimmermare**
